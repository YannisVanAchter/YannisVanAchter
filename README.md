# Hi, I'm Yannis Van Achter, 

A bachelor student in computer science at UNamur in Belgium.

Currently halfway through my first year and in my second year, I'm involved in a junior enterprise called <a href="https://www.cslabs.be/">CSLabs</a>.
My work within this JE consists in organizing trainings, managing the wiki and the Youtube channel of the CSLabs as well as a little bit of administrative work like any company administrator.
But I don't only do that, I also participate in the organisation of the annual event of the JE which is the Hackathon. And I'm also involved in an internal project to manage the company's members.

My skills range from back-end development in Python (my favorite language), to React.JS (with TypeScript or JavaScript) 
You can see my talent on TypeScript thanks to the Hackathon website I managed for the 2023 edition.
I also have some notion of C and Java that I use in my classes.

To contact me use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannis-van-achter-745605224/">LinkedIn</a> or my professional address at CSLabs (<a href="mailto:training@cslabs.be?subject=Contact">training@cslabs.be</a>)
